# Sprint Dev ProgramThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [Sprint Dev Program APIs](http://developer.sprint.com/dynamicContent/sprintservices/devtools/6). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Sprint Dev Program APIs](http://developer.sprint.com/dynamicContent/sprintservices/devtools/6).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://developer.sprint.com/dynamicContent/sprintservices/devtools/6)- [Developer](http://developer.sprint.com/dynamicContent/sprintservices/devtools/6)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sprintdeveloper)- [GitHub](https://github.com/sprint)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/sprint-dev-program/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Sprint Dev Program APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
